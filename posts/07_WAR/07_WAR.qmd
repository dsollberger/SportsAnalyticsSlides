## WAR

:::{.callout-note}
## WAR

WAR (wins above replacement) gives an analyst a sense of how much a player contributes to the team versus a replacement-level player.

## Two Types of WAR

There are two main sources that calculate WAR, but with different formulas:

- Baseball Reference
- FanGraphs
:::

## bWAR

The WAR calculation over at Baseball Reference is called bWAR, and the overall scheme is

$$bWar = (P_{\text{runs}} - A_{\text{runs}}) + (A_{\text{runs}} - R_{\text{runs}})$$

whose terms are computed with factors such as

- batting runs
- baserunning runs
- runs added or lost due to grounding into double plays
- fielding runs
- positional adjustment runs

These factors are compared to the league average where a value of 0 represents an average player.

:::{.callout-important collapse="true"}
## wOBA

Batting runs depends on weighted runs above average

$$wRAA = \frac{wOBA - 0.320}{1.25}*(AB + BB + HBP + SF + SH)$$

where

$$wOBA = \frac{ \alpha_{1}*uBB + \alpha_{2}*HBP + \alpha_{3}*1B + \alpha_{4}*2B + \alpha_{5}*3B + \alpha_{6}*HR + \alpha_{7}*SB - \alpha_{8}*CS }{ AB + BB - IBB + HBP + SF }$$
:::


## fWAR

The FanGraphs formula for position players involves offense, defense, and baserunning.

$$fWAR = wRAA + UZR + position + \frac{20}{600}*PA$$

- runs above average
- ultimate zone rating
- ultimate base running
- park factors

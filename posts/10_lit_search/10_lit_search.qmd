Today, I wanted to use AI tools (artificial intelligence) to guide discussions about literature reviews in our Sports Analytics course.  Here is a great resource to get an overview of these tools:

* [Texas A&M University research guide on AI-based literature review tools](https://tamu.libguides.com/c.php?g=1289555)

# Bing

Microsoft's search engine claims to be able to leverage AI to aid researchers.  Here, I performed a search for

* "advanced baseball statistics papers"

and I was pleased to see a few recent peer-reviewed papers listed at the top.

# Semantic Scholar

Semantic Scholar is a website with a clean interface that allows researchers to find papers quickly in their area of interest.  Here, I performed a search for

* "advanced baseball statistics"

and I was happy to find a variety of papers from realms such as baseball journalism, sports fitness, and economics.


# Research Rabbit

One of my colleagues told us about Research Rabbit at a workshop, so here I gave that app a test run---seeded with one of the papers that I found in a search above.

One of the appeals is the creation of a citation graph that connects papers.  A researcher can then read through a curated selection of papers and become an expert in an arena.

Today we are going to try out convenient code packages to quickly explore our sports data sets.

# Example

To install a package, we use the `install.packages()` function in the console.  For example, when I want to install the `skimr` package, I use the following line of code.

```
install.packages("skimr")
```

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
# load the code packages
#library("skimr")
library("tidyverse")
```

Since we have a CSV file, I recommend using the `read_csv()` function in the `readr` package (a part of the `tidyverse`).  At first, I like to save the data into a variable called `df` ("data frame").

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
# load the data
df <- readr::read_csv("baseball_data_90s.csv")
```

Now, having read the `skimr` documentation, I can try out its summary function on the `df` data frame.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
skimr::skim(df)
```


# Exercise

Now it is your turn!  First, instead of `skimr`, *install* the package that has been assigned to your group.

* `DataExplorer`
* `dataMaid`
* `gtExtras`
* `SmartEDA`
* `summarytools`

Next, load the code package using the `library()` function.

```{r}

```

Since we have a CSV file, I recommend using the `read_csv()` function in the `readr` package (a part of the `tidyverse`).  Use the file that is available for your group.

```{r}

```

Finally, look at the documentation for your group's code package, and use the summary function that has been recommended.

* `DataExplorer::plot_intro()`
* `dataMaid::visualize()`
* `gtExtras::gt_plt_summary()`
* `SmartEDA::ExpData()`
* `summarytools::dfSummary()`

```{r}

```

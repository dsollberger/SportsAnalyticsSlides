# The Story of Glenn Burke

Glenn Burke was an outfielder with the 1977 World Series champion Dodgers.  He was born in Oakland in 1952.

## Load the Tidyverse

The `tidyverse` suite of packages are streamlined to make data science processes easier.  We can load the packages with the `library()` command.

```{r}
# library("Lahman") #baseball data set
library("readxl")
library("tidyverse")

# subset of the Batting data in the Lahman database
# df_Burke <- Batting |>
  
  # focus on Glenn Burke
  # abbreviation found via playerInfo() helper function
  # filter(playerID == "burkegl01")

# df_1977 <- Batting |>
  # filter(yearID == 1977) |>
  # filter(H > 0) #to ease later histogram (remove players who had zero hits)

# readr::write_csv(df_Burke, "data_Burke.csv")
# readr::write_csv(df_1977, "data_1977.csv")
```

Today's data set comes from the [`Lahman` package](https://github.com/cdalzell/Lahman), which contains a lot of historical data about Major League Baseball.

# CSV Files

When we have a CSV file (comma-separated values), the `read_csv()` command in the  `readr` package will be convenient here.  I tend to save data set into a variable `df` (stands for "data frame").

```{r}
df_1977 <- readr::read_csv("data_1977.csv")
```

## Look at the Data

One way to get a quick look at the data set is with the `head()` command (outputs the first few rows and columns).

```{r}
head(df_1977)
```

We can also look at the *structure* of a data frame with the `str()` command.  In particular, this view allows us to quickly see which variables are *numerical* and which are *categorical*.

```{r}
str(df_1977, give.attr = FALSE)
```

Another convenient tool for our programming purposes is looking at the *column names* (i.e. variable names that we need to type later)

```{r}
colnames(df_1977)
```

## A Starter Histogram

A `histogram` is used to visualize the *distribution* of a numerical variable.

```{r}
df_1977 |>
  ggplot(aes(x = H)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(title = "Hits",
       subtitle = "1977 season",
       caption = "Spark 01",
       x = "hits")
```

## Colors

This is a distribution the the number of clean hits by MLB batters in the 1977 season.

```{r}
df_1977 |>
  ggplot(aes(x = H)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "blue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Hits",
       subtitle = "1977 season",
       caption = "Spark 01",
       x = "hits")
```

## Label(s)

Glenn Burke himself had 43 hits (playing a bench role).

```{r}
df_1977 |>
  ggplot(aes(x = H)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "blue", color = "black") +
  geom_segment(aes(x = 93, y = 50, xend = 43, yend = 0),
               arrow = arrow(), color = "red", size = 3) +
  geom_label(aes(x = 43, y = 0, label = "Glenn Burke"),
             nudge_x = 50, nudge_y = 50) +
  labs(title = "Hits",
       subtitle = "1977 season",
       caption = "Spark 01",
       x = "hits")
```

Remember that we can get also get a sense of a player comparing them to the summary statistics.

```{r}
df_1977 |>
  summarize(xbar = mean(H, na.rm = TRUE),
            median = median(H, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd = sd(H, na.rm = TRUE))
```

# Excel Files

When we have an Excel file (i.e. Microsoft Excel), the `read_xlsx()` command in the  `readxl` package will be convenient here.

```{r}
df_Burke <- readxl::read_xlsx("data_Burke.xlsx")
```

## Look at the Data

One way to get a quick look at the data set is with the `head()` command (outputs the first few rows and columns).

```{r}
head(df_Burke)
```

We can also look at the *structure* of a data frame with the `str()` command.  In particular, this view allows us to quickly see which variables are *numerical* and which are *categorical*.

```{r}
str(df_Burke, give.attr = FALSE)
```

Another convenient tool for our programming purposes is looking at the *column names* (i.e. variable names that we need to type later)

```{r}
colnames(df_Burke)
```

## Bar Plot (by identity)

Bar plots are easy for readers to understand, but a little tricky to produce.  We usually make bar plots with a categorical variable on the $x$-axis and a numerical variable on the $y$-axis.

When we want to use the numbers from the data frame directly, be sure to specify the `stat = "identity"` parameter.

```{r}
df_Burke |>
  ggplot(aes(x = yearID, y = G, fill = teamID)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Glenn Burke: A Brief Time in the Major Leagues",
       subtitle = "He spent seasons with the Dodgers and the Athletics",
       caption = "Spark 01",
       x = "season", y = "games played")
```

## Bar Plot (by count)

When we want the bar plot to reflect the number of observations (i.e. number of rows) for each category, then use the `stat = "count"` parameter.

```{r}
df_Burke |>
  ggplot(aes(x = teamID, fill = teamID)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "count") +
  labs(title = "Glenn Burke: A Brief Time in the Major Leagues",
       subtitle = "He spent seasons with the Dodgers and the Athletics",
       caption = "Spark 01",
       x = "team", y = "seasons played")
```

## Health Precautions

Health precautions: Conducting scholarly work under (post-)pandemic conditions simply
extend values long established in higher education and respected in UC Merced's Principles of
Community. In enrolling at UCM and in this course, we will observe the following:

* Appreciate and support the physical and psychological nuances of returning to an in-person classroom.
* Keep informed on current campus information and maintain a consistent practice
* If symptomatic, quarantining is expected along with notification to the Covid Response Center https://doyourpart.ucmerced.edu/crc for tracking and support

As a reminder, the above expectations are consistent with our campus' Code of Student
Conduct, which emphasizes that a productive and safe campus involves honesty, fairness, and
respect. Circumstances and guidelines may change, and we will discuss important updates
to affirm any updates or adjustments to classroom plans. This transition is new for all of
us, and we are in this together as a classroom community. If you have questions, you are
encouraged to stay in touch with me and/or UCM's Campus Ready COVID-19 site is an
ongoing resource: https://doyourpart.ucmerced.edu/crc

## Academic Integrity Policy 

Academic integrity is the foundation of an academic community and without it none of the educational or research goals of the university can be achieved. All members of the community are responsible for its academic integrity. Existing policies forbid cheating on examinations, plagiarism and other forms of academic dishonesty. The UC Merced Academic Honesty Policy can be found on the Student Conduct website. Infractions against academic integrity will incur consequences such as an “F” on the assignment/exam and/or a report to the Academic Senate (http://studentconduct.ucmerced.edu)

# Learning Environment

## Cooperative Classroom

Learning in a cooperative environment should be stimulating, demanding, and fair.  Because this approach to learning is different from the competitive classroom structure that many other courses used to be based on, it is important for us to be clear about mutual expectations.  Below are my expectations for students in this class.  This set of expectations is intended to maximize debate and exchange of ideas in an atmosphere of mutual respect while preserving individual ownership of ideas and written words.  If you feel you do not understand or cannot agree to these expectations, you should discuss this with your instructor and classmates.

1.	Students are expected to work cooperatively with other members of the class and show respect for the ideas and contributions of other people.
2.	When working as part of a group, students should strive to be good contributors to the group, listen to others, not dominate, and recognize the contributions of others.  Students should try to ensure that everyone in the group is welcome to contribute and recognize that everyone contributes in different ways to a group process.
3.	Students should explore data, make observations, and develop inferences as part of a group.  If you use material from published sources, you must provide appropriate attribution.

## Pep Talk

Learning R can be difficult at first---it is like learning a new language, just like Spanish, French, or
Chinese. Hadley Wickham---the chief data scientist at RStudio and the author of some amazing R packages you will be using like `ggplot2`---made this wise observation:

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}

## Wisdom from Hadley Wickham

It's easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it's me, I'm really stupid,” or, “I'm not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It's just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don't blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.

If you are finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head against a wall and not understanding, take a break, talk to classmates, ask questions ... e-mail [Derek], etc.  I promise you can do this.

---Andrew Heiss, Georgia State University   

## Inclusion Statement

I value all students regardless of their background, country of origin, race, religion, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, disability status, etc. and am committed to providing a climate of excellence and inclusiveness within all aspects of the course. If there are aspects of your culture or identity that you would like to share with me as they relate to your success in this class, I am happy to meet to discuss. Likewise, if you have any concerns in this area or facing any special issues or challenges, you are encouraged to discuss the matter with me (set up a meeting by e-mail) with an assurance of full confidentiality (only exception being mandatory reporting of academic integrity code violations or sexual harassment).
